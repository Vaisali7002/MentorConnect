# MentorConnect — Student Mentor Collaboration Platform


## Overview

MentorConnect is a web-based mentorship platform designed to bridge the gap between students and experienced mentors by creating a structured environment for career guidance and professional development.

The platform enables students to seek mentorship in critical career areas while allowing mentors to review requests and make informed decisions through a role-based workflow system.

Built as a full-stack web application using Python Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS, and Jinja templating.
